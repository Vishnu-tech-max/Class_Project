Codon Lookup - 
Codons represent the fundamental language of molecular biology, serving as triplets of nucleotides within messenger RNA that encode specific amino acids, thereby dictating the primary structure of proteins. This mapping, known as the genetic code, is both redundant and nearly universal: 64 possible codons correspond to only 20 amino acids plus start and stop signals, meaning that multiple codons can specify the same amino acid, a feature that provides resilience against mutational errors. Translation begins when the ribosome recognizes the start codon (AUG, coding for methionine), and proceeds codon by codon, with transfer RNAs delivering the appropriate amino acids whose anticodons complement the mRNA sequence. The ribosome catalyzes peptide bond formation, elongating the polypeptide chain until a stop codon halts the process, releasing the completed protein. This elegant system exemplifies the central dogma—DNA transcribed into RNA, RNA translated into protein—and highlights the interplay between information storage and functional expression in living systems. In essence, our Python program that maps codons to amino acids mirrors this biological decoding process, explaining the ribosome’s role as a computational lookup.
